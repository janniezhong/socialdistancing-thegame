    <p class = "text"> Between Us is a game that raises awareness on how to maintain a healthy physical distance from those
    around you. </p>
    <h2 class = "subtitle"> Instructions </h2>
    <p class = "text"> The main player can move left and right using the arrow keys and must dodge people who may potentially be infected 
    by COVID-19. The main player has 3 masks, serving as lives and for each time the player hits an obstacle with a mask, the player has 
    half a mask detracted from their total. If they hit an obstacle without a mask, the player has a full mask detracted from their total 
    number of masks. As the player survives longer and longer, the track will speed up, calculating the player's score based on how long 
    they live. Once the player runs out of masks, the game ends. </p>
